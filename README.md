# atom-dawn-syntax

A port of the TextMate *"Dawn"* syntax theme for Atom >= 1.13.0.

This work was originally started by [@phthhieu](https://github.com/phthhieu) as [textmate-dawn-mod1-syntax](https://github.com/phthhieu/textmate-dawn-mod1-syntax).

I mainly updated the styles declaration to comply with Atom >= 1.13.0 as per Deprecation Cop recommendations.

## Installation

### Via CLI

```
apm install atom-dawn-fork-syntax
```

### Using Atom

Go to `Settings → Install`, switch the tab from `Packages` to `Themes` and search for **atom-dawn-fork-syntax**.

After that, go to `Settings → Themes` and select  **Atom Dawn** in the "Syntax Theme" drop-down list.


## Usage

As in the screenshot above I use this syntax theme under macOS with the following themes/packages:

* [file-icons](https://github.com/file-icons/atom)
